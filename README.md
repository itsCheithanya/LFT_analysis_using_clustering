# Aventus-Hackathon
The liver has a significant role in metabolism, digestion, detoxification, and
elimination of substances from the body. The liver function test also known as
liver panel, liver function panel, typically includes Albumin, cholesterol,
alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), serum bilirubin, total
protein, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), Serum glutamic
pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and Globulin.
Healthcare professionals are well-trained to make significant observations in the
test results and classify them as normal or disease patterns. Supervised and/or
unsupervised ML algorithms to detect the possibility of liver disease in a similar
way to assist healthcare workers and signatories. Patterns in the diseases can
also alert the signatories of the possible outlier results that may be erroneous
and may not reflect any disease pattern.
Note: The test results are interpreted as normal or abnormal based on the
reference ranges which may be specific to age/gender/ instruments/the
method of testing.
